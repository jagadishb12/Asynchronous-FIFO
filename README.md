# Asynchronous-FIFO
--An Asynchronous FIFO Design involves writing data values to a FIFO memory from one clock domain and 
reading data values from a different clock domain, both of which are asynchronous to each other.

--Asynchronous FIFOs find extensive application in securely transferring data between distinct clock domains

--The whole design was implemented in **Quartus** using **Verilog** and simulated in **ModelSim** with 
proper testbenches.

--Steps to design this FIFO:
1. First understand the theory which was provided in two pdfs --22M1101_16X8 Asynchronous FIFO Design.pdf & TI_Asynchronous FIFO.pdf
2. Next, Use any one of Digital design Tool(Quartus or Iverilog) & copy all verilog files into your project.
3. Run RTL simulations with proper testbenches & verify it's functionality.
